# Welcome to Rent and Run ðŸ‘‹

This was the 'AirBnB Clone Project' of the Le Wagon coding bootcamp. ðŸ’»
These are the team members, who have created the app:

1. [Camille](https://github.com/camille-celine)
2. [Sebastian](https://github.com/Sebastianbrd)
3. [Ioan-Andrey](https://github.com/Ioan93Andrei)
4. [Nick](https://github.com/nkhape)


We created an app, which lets users rent (and rent out) their sports equipment. An example of a user, who would benefit from this is someone, who likes trying many different sports, but does not have the resources to purchase all the equipment necessary.

We built this app with Ruby on Rails, CSS, Bootstrap & HTML.

You can check out the app [HERE](https://rent-and-run.herokuapp.com/)

**Here's a sneak peak of what the app looks like:**
